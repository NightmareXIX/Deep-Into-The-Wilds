# DEEP INTO THE WILDS
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
My final project is a 2d side-scroller/shooting game that is made with the pygame module of python. The name of my game is ***Deep Into The Wilds***.

### Concept:
The concept of this game is to defeat as much enemies as possible. The game is based on a point system which indicates how many enemies the player has defeated. The player is a alien that is placed in a dark forest where he has to face tons of enemies and hence the name ***DEEP INTO THE WILDS***. The player has the ability to shoot enemies and defeat them. Player takes damage by colliding with the enemy sprites/bullets generated by them.

### Controls:
Press A to move left and press D to move right. Press SPACE or RIGHT CLICK to jump. Press LEFT CLICK and position mouse LEFT or RIGHT of player to shoot in that direction. You can shoot enemies and bullets generated by them.

### Game Mechanics:
Player has a HP of 100. If HP turns 0 then the game will end. The game has a scoring system that is the number of enemies defeated by player. The player must avoid the enemies attack and defeat as many enemies as possible.

### How to set up:
Using a IDE install python and import pygame module using pip. Run `game.py` to play the game.

### Game UI:
After running the game user will be prompted to the window seen below.
